I typed that all into the terminal and was able to connect to the `ieng6` server with the `ssh` command using my UCSD specific login information.

(The last part is the SSH URL.) I typed that into the terminal and was able to create a copy of my remote Github repository onto my computer with the  `git clone` command.
