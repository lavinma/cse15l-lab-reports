# Lab Report 4 - Vim (Week 7)

<br/>Logging into ieng6: The keys I used to get to this point was `s` `s` `h` `<space>` `l` `a` `m` `0` `0` `9` `@` `i` `e` `n` `g` `6` `.` `u` `c` `s` `d` `.` `e` `d` `u`. I typed that all into the terminal and was able to connect to the `ieng6` server with the `ssh` command using my UCSD specific login information. The `ssh` command stands for secure shell and connects two devices (in my case my computer to a server).
