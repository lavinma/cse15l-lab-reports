![Image 1-15-24 at 11 14 AM](https://github.com/lavinma/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/156377218/f217a889-99cd-4c73-8b8b-d1253ee5e86c)

The **first** command is an example of the `cd` command being used with no arguments. 
   When that command was run, the working directory was `home`. The working directory did not change when I ran the command because 
   because no argument was present in the command line, meaning it wasn't told what directory to change to. There was no output error.
<br/> The **second** command is an example of the `cd` commaand being used with a *directory* as an argument.
   When the command was run, the working directory was `lecturel` because the cd command changed the current directory, `home`, to 
   the argument, `lecture1`. The output is not an error.
<br/> The **third** command is an example of the `cd` command with a path to a *file* as an argument.
   When the command was run, the working directory was still `lecture1` because the argument being a path to a file is not correct. 
   The arguments given to the `cd` command can only be directories, not files. The command outputted an error because of this.
